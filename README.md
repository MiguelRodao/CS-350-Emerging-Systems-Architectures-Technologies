Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was a prototype for a thermostat, and the problem it was solving is knowing the temperature of a particular room or environment.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I assembled the parts of this thermostat really well. For this project, I just had to follow instructions to be able to create a good thermostat, and as long as I followed instructions and connected everything in the right place there was nothing too complicated to finish. I was also able to complete the functional code correctly, and there were not that many errors on the execution code.

Where could you improve?
I could improve and learn what each element does on the board. I was able to complete all of the project by following instructions, but I should be able to modify and create new things with these elements. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
There was nothing new I had to use for class or project. I would say I have to learn how to write better questions when I am working with Google and AI.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Follow instruction and read everything BEFORE you start working on anything. There have been more than one occasion where I had to read everything to be able to finish an assignment. Read EVERYTHING first before trying to continue with the activity.
